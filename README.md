# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Hotels Visiting App

## Automatic Firebase Deployment Setup

This app is configured to automatically deploy to Firebase Hosting when you push changes to the main branch.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Add Firebase Service Account to GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Settings" → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_HOTELS_VISITING`
   - Value: Copy the entire content of your Firebase service account JSON file

2. **Get Your Firebase Service Account JSON:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Download the JSON file
   - Copy the entire content of this JSON file as the secret value

### How it works:

1. When you push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically triggers the deployment workflow
3. The workflow builds your React app and deploys it to Firebase Hosting
4. Your website is updated automatically at: https://hotels-visiting.web.app

### To deploy:

Simply commit and push your changes to the main branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

The deployment will happen automatically!

### Security Note:
- Never commit Firebase service account credentials to your repository
- Always use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
- Keep your service account JSON file secure on your local machine
